# Advanced Genomics and Genetic Analyses

## Coursework
Refer to the folder "assignments" for attempted lab and homework assignments.

## Final Project
Refer to the folder "final_project" for R code and the relevant figures and tables generated.

Project goals:
-
-
- Identify top discriminating genes from gene expression data collected on Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays from WT (Polg<sup>+/+</sup>) vs. D257A mutant (Polg<sup>D257A/D257A</sup>) mice cochlear tissue samples (n=10)
- Investigate the functional roles and associated biological processes of the identified gene products
